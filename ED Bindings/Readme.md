# Elite Dangerous Binding Files #

These files map controls setup in the scripts, into Elite Dangerous. Key mappings align with TARGET Script _AD_EDKeyMap_v4.x.x.ttm_. There are also some commands mapped only in the binding files, outside of the script.

### Which One to Choose? ###

Do you own/play with one of these rudder pedals _(pictured below)_?

 __YES__, choose 'WITH MFG Crosswind'. __NO__, choose 'WITHOUT MFG Crosswind'.

## MFG Configurator ##

For those who have a set of MFG Crosswind Rudder Pedals, these are the settings I am using with my profile. Toe Brake is combined & I have the tension on both the Toe & Rudder fairly high to offer good accuracy.

Please ensure you are running the latest software/firmware version from [here](https://mfg.simundza.com/downloads "MFG Downloads").
